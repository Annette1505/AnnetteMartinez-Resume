        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Annette Martinez (She/Her) and I am currently a Freshman Undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently studying Pre-Business. I am originally from Los Angeles, California and have resided in Southern California for my entire life. I am also a Latina/Chicana. I live with both my parents and my older sister. I am a first generation college student who is motivated to succeed after seeing my parents deal with hardships. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and loved ones. I enjoy being in a creative setting and letting loose which has also been a way I can relieve stress during hard times. 

<br><br>

        For my future I aspire to be someone who is involved in many clubs, internships, and programs in order to network throughout my college career. A goal of mine is to do an internship during summer 2024 in hopes to expand my knowledge on the vast topic of business. Another goal of mine is to narrow down my options for my business concentration. As for school, my main goal is to maintain good grades and stay on task when it comes to the workload. I would consider myself to be very professional in a work setting. As well as a great team player, organized, creative, and can be flexible. I am also good at adapting to new environments, a quick learner, and can problem solve in most situations. I believe that I can be a great and beneficial asset to any team as I know what I am capable of and would never put others or myself in a position where a task cannot be completed.<br><br>

        In the past I have participated in various clubs and organizations. For example, I was a part of the Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles (YOLA) for about 10+ years. Throughout this program I was able to learn and master playing the violin. I also attended and participated in various concerts, workshops, classes, and galas for my program. Likewise, I was also a part of The Harmony Project organization who partnered with YOLA. I've had the opportunity to be a public speaker at the 2023 Harmony Project Gala where I shared my journey being a musician and also participating in other clubs. While in high school, I was a part of The Giving Committee. In this club we focused on bettering our community and also extending our hands out for other nonprofit organizations that needed the help. I was also a college ambassador for my high school. As an ambassador I was tasked with helping out the senior class with college applications, school choices, and promoting college tours and college meetings with potential school options. I along with my team of ambassadors often took on tasks of running our college center social media, and finding internships and scholarships for students. 
In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and loved ones. I enjoy being in a creative setting and letting loose which has also been a way I can relieve stress during hard times.
